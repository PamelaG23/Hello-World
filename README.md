# Hello-World
Making my breakthrough of coding with Github for the first time!

<strong>Hey! I'm Pamela (Pam)</strong>
 <p> 
I'm an aspiring Front-End Developer. Great to be here!

I love to keep myself busy (which requires a lot of coffee and snacks) but this is why I have come to love coding more and more.
It suits my lifestlye and constantly challenges the drive I have to <em>"Keep going and get it done!"</em>
aside from that, I'm hoping to make some great connections here and meet people along the way that can aid me in my journey.
